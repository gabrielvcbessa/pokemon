# Objective

In most pokemon games the player has to make a choice: to choose six Pokemons to carry and let all the others on the "Pokémon Center". Usually, this choice is made based on how much the player likes each one of them, their level, their rarity or other random feature, but we will take another approach.

We will rank all Pokemons based on how effective they are against others, so we can chose our six Pokemons in a bias-less manner.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

df <- read.csv('pokemon.csv')

df[df == ''] <- NA # We want to replace every non-existing value with NA

df <- df %>% rename(against_fighting = against_fight)
df <- transform(
  df, 
  sprite = paste(
    'http://raw.githubusercontent.com/gabrielvcbessa/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon', 
    pokedex_number, 
    sep = '/')) %>% 
  mutate(sprite = paste(sprite, '.png', sep = ''))

df$is_legendary <- as.factor(df$is_legendary == '1')
df$generation <- as.ordered(df$generation)
```

# Exploratory Analysis

The damage in pokemon is calculated based on multiple factors, but on our estimation we will just use attack, defense and type effectiveness (as described on the "Damage estimation" section). So let's try to infeer which caracteristics a good pokemon might have through an exploratory data analysis.

To start things off, let's see how types are distributed among all Pokemons:

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(gridExtra)
library(ggplot2)

plot_theme <- theme_minimal()

df.by_type <- df %>% 
  group_by(type1) %>% 
  summarise(type_count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(type_per = type_count / sum(type_count)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(type_count))

ggplot(df.by_type, 
       aes(reorder(type1, type_count), type_count, fill = type1)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = 'Type', y = 'Pokemons in sample') +
  plot_theme +
  theme(legend.position = 'none')
```

Our three most common pokemon types are: Water (14.23%), Normal (13.10%) and Grass (9.73%). So picking a pokemon that is good against water types might be a good option.

Besides type effectiveness, our damage depends only on attack and defense. Legendary Pokemons are known for being stronger than other Pokemons, let's see if this holds true when analysing those features:

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(GGally)

p1 <- ggplot(df, aes(is_legendary, attack)) +
  geom_violin() +
  labs(x = 'Legendary', y = 'Attack') +
  plot_theme

p2 <- ggplot(df, aes(is_legendary, defense)) +
  geom_violin() +
    labs(x = 'Legendary', y = 'Defense') +
  plot_theme

p3 <- ggplot(df, aes(is_legendary, sp_attack)) +
  geom_violin() +
  labs(x = 'Legendary', y = 'Special Attack') +
  plot_theme

p4 <- ggplot(df, aes(is_legendary, sp_defense)) +
  geom_violin() +
  labs(x = 'Legendary', y = 'Special Defense') +
  plot_theme

grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, ncol = 4)
```

As we can see, almost 75% of legendary Pokemons are stronger if considering those features than the majority of "non-legendary" Pokemons. So, a simple strategy would be picking a legendary pokemon that is good against water type Pokemons as our first pick. Of course, we are considering that we could choose between a lendary or a "non-legendary" Pokemon, but we know that lendary pokemons are a much more difficult to find and catch.

# Damage estimation

To calculate each pokemon damage output and how much damage it would take from others, we are going to use a simplified version of the damage calculation presented by [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Damage#Damage_calculation). 

We are going to consider all Pokemons having the same level, power and are going to use just type effectiveness (Type) as our modifier. This changes are made because we don't have any information about the abilities that a specific pokemon can use, other than their name. Thus, our damage will be calculated as:

![](./simp_damage_calc.png)

Every pokemon have a default attack/defense and a special one. So, to estimate how much damage a pokemon will cause, we are going to calculate the average of those two attacks:

![](./complete_damage_calc.png)

For each pokemon, we are going to calculate the damage it would deal and how much damage it would take from all other Pokemons, using the formula presented above.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df$est_damage_output <- NA
df$est_damage_taken <- NA

attacks.all <- data.frame(row.names = 1:nrow(df))

for(i in 1:nrow(df)) {
  attacker <- df[i, ]
  attacker.attacks <- c()
  
  for(j in 1:nrow(df)) {
    defender <- df[j, ]

    damage.default <- attacker$attack / defender$defense
    damage.sp <- attacker$sp_attack / defender$sp_defense
    damage.avg <- (damage.default + damage.sp) / 2
    damage.avg <- damage.avg * attacker[, paste('against_', defender$type1, sep = '')]
    
    attacker.attacks <- append(attacker.attacks, 
                               damage.avg, 
                               after = length(attacker.attacks))
  }
  
  attacks.all <- cbind(attacks.all, 
                       attacker.attacks)
  
  df[i, ]$est_damage_output <- median(attacker.attacks)
}

rownames(attacks.all) <- df$name
colnames(attacks.all) <- df$name

for (i in 1:nrow(attacks.all)) {
  damage.taken <- as.numeric(attacks.all[i ,])
  df[i, ]$est_damage_taken <- median(damage.taken)
}
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(est_damage_output, est_damage_taken, color = is_legendary)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .75) +
  labs(x = 'Median Estimated Damage Output', 
       y = 'Median Estimated Damage Taken',
       color = 'Legendary') +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 4)) +
  plot_theme
```

Most of the Pokemons have an estimated damage output similar to the estimated damage taken, but this doesn't seems to hold true to Pokemons with an damage output greater than 1.5. Those Pokemos have high damage output and also a good defense.

Here are our top one hunderd fifty pokemons when sorted by estimated damage output, feel free to choose your top six and I see you on the battleground.
