## Dimensionality reduction

This document will explore how dimensionality reduction techniques can help us understanding our pokemon dataset.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(Rtsne)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

library(mice)

df.original <- read.csv('pokemon.csv')
df <- read.csv('pokemon_complete.csv')

setdiff(names(df), names(df.original)) # We added 6 new features
```
